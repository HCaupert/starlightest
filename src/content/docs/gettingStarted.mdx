Let's find out how to set up **Express Checkout** (also called **xcheckout** or **XCO**).

Before you get started, make sure to **check** with the express checkout team that **your domain is allowed.**
Most likely `localhost:...` for local dev

Currently, we have to setup this manually, but soon, this will be handled automatically.

## Install Express Checkout Widget

The widget is deployed on a private github package repository, so you need to authenticate to install it.

You can ask for a token to the XCO team.

Then, install the widget using your favorite package manager:

<Tabs syncKey="packageManager">
  <TabItem label="npm" default>
      ```bash
      npm install @xcheckout/widget
      ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
      ```bash
      yarn add @xcheckout/widget
      ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
      ```bash
      pnpm add @xcheckout/widget
      ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun">
      ```bash
      bun add @xcheckout/widget
      ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Use Express Checkout Widget

First you must import the widget:

```ts app.ts
import { Widget } from "@xcheckout/widget";
```

Next, add an HTML element _with an id_ where the widget will be attached.

```html app.ts
<div id="xco-widget"></div>
```

Finally, instantiate the widget and call the `mount` method with the HTML element's _id_:

```ts app.ts
new Widget({
  entityId: "your-purse-entity-id", // your Purse entity ID
  manager: manager, // an implementation of ExpressCheckoutManager
}).mount("xco-widget");
```

As you might notice, you need to :

- provide your Purse entity ID.
- provide the url of the XCO domain.
- create an ExpressCheckoutManager to interact with the widget.

How to do so is explained in the [next section](./usecase).
